"What is data?","Random numbers","Facts or numbers collected about things","A type of graph","A computer program","b","class6-what-is-data","Data refers to individual facts, statistics, or pieces of information collected through observation, measurement, or research. It can be numbers, words, measurements, or observations used as a basis for reasoning or calculation."
"Which method involves asking people questions to gather information?","Observation","Survey","Measurement","Experimentation","b","class6-collecting-data-methods","A survey is a data collection method that involves asking a set of questions to a group of people to gather information about their opinions, behaviors, or characteristics. It is commonly used for polls and questionnaires."
"To quickly count votes for four different colors, which method is most efficient?","Writing a paragraph","Using tally marks","Drawing a detailed picture","Listing alphabetically","b","class6-organizing-data-tally","Tally marks are a simple, visual counting system where each mark represents one item, and every fifth mark is drawn across the previous four. This grouping by fives makes counting large numbers efficient and reduces errors."
"Why is it useful to represent data visually with graphs?","Graphs are colorful","Graphs make data harder to understand","Our brains process pictures faster than raw numbers","Graphs take less time to draw","c","class6-why-visualize-data","Visual representations like graphs and charts help our brains quickly identify patterns, trends, and comparisons in data. Pictures are processed more efficiently than tables of numbers, making the information clearer and more memorable."
"In a pictograph, what is the purpose of a 'key'?","To lock the data","To show what each symbol represents","To list the people who collected data","To color the graph","b","class6-pictograph-basics","A key (or legend) in a pictograph explains the value represented by each picture or symbol. For example, it might state that one apple symbol 🍎 represents 5 actual apples, ensuring the reader interprets the graph correctly."
"In a pictograph about book reading, if 📚 = 2 books, how many books does 📚📚📚 represent?","2 books","3 books","5 books","6 books","d","class6-pictograph-example","If one symbol (📚) represents 2 books, then three symbols represent 3 × 2 = 6 books. To find the total from a pictograph, multiply the number of symbols by the value each symbol represents (as shown in the key)."
"Which part of a bar graph displays the categories being compared (e.g., fruit names)?","The Title","The Y-axis","The X-axis","The Bars","c","class6-bar-graph-basics","In a standard bar graph, the horizontal axis (X-axis) displays the categories or groups being compared, such as different types of fruit, months, or names. The vertical axis (Y-axis) displays the numerical scale or frequency."
"What is the first step in creating a bar graph?","Color the bars","Draw the bars","Choose a scale and draw the X and Y axes","Write a title","c","class6-creating-bar-graph","The foundational step is to draw the two perpendicular axes: the horizontal X-axis (for categories) and the vertical Y-axis (for the numerical scale). You must then decide on an appropriate, consistent scale for the Y-axis before drawing bars."
"In a bar graph showing books read, if Riya's bar goes up to the mark for 8 on the Y-axis, how many books did she read?","4","6","8","10","c","class6-bar-graph-example","The height of a bar corresponds to its value on the Y-axis scale. If the top of Riya's bar aligns with the number 8 on the Y-axis, it means she read 8 books."
"When reading a bar graph, what does the tallest bar indicate?","The least amount","The most amount","The average amount","Nothing specific","b","class6-reading-graphs","In a bar graph, the length or height of each bar is proportional to the value it represents. Therefore, the tallest bar corresponds to the category with the largest value or highest frequency."
"You want to compare the precise number of students from four different classes who play football. Which graph is most appropriate?","Pictograph","Bar Graph","A written list","A pie chart","b","class6-choosing-right-graph","A bar graph is ideal for comparing quantities across different categories precisely because the exact value can be read from the Y-axis scale. Pictographs are better for simpler comparisons or younger audiences."
"The 'Mean' of a set of numbers is calculated by:","Finding the middle number","Finding the most frequent number","Adding all numbers and dividing by the count","Subtracting the smallest from largest","c","class7-mean-average","The mean (or average) is the sum of all values in a dataset divided by the number of values. It represents the arithmetic center or fair share value of the data."
"To find the 'Median' of the data set: 12, 3, 7, 15, 8, what is the first step?","Add all numbers","Find the most common number","Arrange the numbers in ascending order","Pick the first number","c","class7-median-average","The median is the middle value when data is ordered. The first step is always to arrange the numbers from smallest to largest: 3, 7, 8, 12, 15. Then you identify the middle number (the 3rd value, which is 8)."
"In the set of shoe sizes: 5, 7, 5, 8, 7, 5, 9, what is the mode?","5","7","8","9","a","class7-mode-average","The mode is the value that appears most frequently. The size 5 appears three times, which is more than any other size (7 appears twice, 8 and 9 appear once each). Therefore, the mode is 5."
"You want to know the most common shirt size sold in a store to plan inventory. Which measure of central tendency should you use?","Mean","Median","Mode","Range","c","class7-choosing-right-average","The mode identifies the most frequent or popular item. For inventory planning of categorical data like shirt sizes, knowing which size sells most often (the mode) is the most useful information."
"If you roll a standard six-sided die once, what is the probability of rolling a 3?","1/2","1/3","1/6","1","c","class7-probability-basics","Probability = (Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Possible Outcomes). A die has 6 equally likely outcomes (1-6). Rolling a '3' is 1 favorable outcome. So, P(3) = 1/6."
"Which of the following events has a probability of 0?","Flipping a coin and getting heads","Rolling a 7 on a standard die","The sun rising tomorrow","Picking a red marble from a bag with only red marbles","b","class7-probability-examples","A standard die has faces numbered 1 through 6. Rolling a 7 is impossible because it is not one of the possible outcomes. Therefore, its probability is 0. The other events have probabilities greater than 0."
"What is the main purpose of a double bar graph?","To show data for a single category","To compare two related sets of data for the same categories","To show parts of a whole","To track data over time for one item","b","class7-double-bar-graphs","A double bar graph uses pairs of bars (often differently colored or patterned) to compare two different data sets across the same categories. For example, it can compare the scores of boys vs. girls in different subjects."
"When data is too numerous to list individually, it is often organized into:","A single average","A probability scale","Groups or class intervals","A pictograph","c","class8-grouped-data","Grouped frequency distribution organizes large datasets into ranges of values called class intervals (e.g., 10-19, 20-29). This summarizes the data, making patterns like the distribution's shape easier to see."
"What is a key visual difference between a bar graph and a histogram?","Histograms have a title","Histograms have no gaps between the bars","Bar graphs use pictures","Histograms are always vertical","b","class8-histogram-basics","Bar graphs have gaps between bars to indicate that the categories are separate and distinct (like 'Apples', 'Oranges'). Histograms have no gaps because they represent continuous numerical data grouped into intervals (like '10-20 cm'), where one interval touches the next."
"In a pie chart, if a category represents 25% of the total data, what is the angle of its sector?","45°","90°","180°","360°","b","class8-pie-chart-basics","A full circle has 360°. The angle for a sector is (Percentage/100) × 360°. For 25%: (25/100) × 360° = 0.25 × 360° = 90°."
"In a survey, 12 out of 50 people prefer tea. What is the angle for the 'Tea' sector in a pie chart?","Approximately 86.4°","Approximately 43.2°","Approximately 24°","360°","a","class8-pie-chart-example","First, find the fraction: 12/50 = 0.24. This means 24% prefer tea. The angle is this fraction of 360°: 0.24 × 360° = 86.4°."
"You flip a coin 100 times and get Heads 55 times. What is the experimental probability of getting Heads?","0.5","0.55","0.45","1.0","b","class8-experimental-probability","Experimental probability is based on actual results from an experiment or trial. It is calculated as (Number of times event occurred) / (Total number of trials). Here, P(Heads) = 55 / 100 = 0.55."
"A weather forecast says there is a 0.8 probability of rain. Where does this lie on the probability scale from 0 to 1?","Closer to 0 (Unlikely)","At 0.5 (Even Chance)","Closer to 1 (Very Likely)","At 1 (Certain)","c","class8-probability-scale","Probability is measured on a scale from 0 (impossible) to 1 (certain). A probability of 0.8 is much closer to 1 than to 0.5, indicating the event is very likely to occur."
