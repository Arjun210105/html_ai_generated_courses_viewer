"In algebra, what do we call letters like 'x' or 'y' that represent unknown numbers?","Constants","Variables","Coefficients","Operators","b","class6-algebra-introduction","These letters are called variables. A variable is a symbol (usually a letter) that represents a number whose value is not yet known or can change. They are placeholders for unknown quantities."
"In the matchstick pattern for connected squares, the rule was found to be: Sticks = 3 × Squares + 1. How many sticks are needed for 7 squares?","21","22","23","24","b","class6-pattern-discovery","Using the rule Sticks = 3 × S + 1, where S is the number of squares. For S = 7, Sticks = (3 × 7) + 1 = 21 + 1 = 22."
"Which of the following correctly translates the phrase 'five less than a number' into an algebraic expression?","5 - n","n - 5","5n","n/5","b","class6-variables-expressions","The phrase 'five less than a number' means you start with the number (n) and then subtract 5. Therefore, the correct expression is n - 5. '5 - n' would mean five minus the number."
"If x - 8 = 4, what is the value of x?","4","8","12","-4","c","class6-balance-equations","To solve x - 8 = 4, you need to find the number that, when 8 is subtracted from it, gives 4. Add 8 to both sides of the equation: x - 8 + 8 = 4 + 8, which simplifies to x = 12."
"What is the term for a number that is multiplied by a variable in an algebraic expression, like the '4' in 4x?","Constant","Variable","Coefficient","Exponent","c","class7-algebraic-expressions-basics","The coefficient is the numerical factor of a term that contains a variable. In the term 4x, 4 is the coefficient and x is the variable. A constant is a term without a variable."
"In the expression 5y - 2x + 7, which is a constant term?","5y","-2x","7","5","c","class7-terms-coefficients","A constant term is a term that contains only a number, with no variable. In the expression 5y - 2x + 7, the number 7 is the constant term. 5y and -2x are variable terms."
"Which two terms are 'like terms'?","3x and 3y","2x² and 2x","5a and 7a","4 and 4b","c","class7-like-unlike-terms","Like terms have the same variable(s) raised to the same exponent(s). 5a and 7a both have the variable 'a' to the first power, so they are like terms. The other pairs have different variables or powers."

"Which of the following is a linear equation?","x² + 2 = 6","2x + 5 = 11","xy = 4","1/x = 2","b","class7-linear-equations-basics","A linear equation is an equation where the highest power of the variable is 1. '2x + 5 = 11' has x to the first power. The others involve exponents other than 1, products of variables, or variables in the denominator."
"Solve for y: 4y = 20","y = 5","y = 16","y = 24","y = 80","a","class7-solving-equations","The equation is 4y = 20. To solve for y, perform the opposite operation. Since y is multiplied by 4, divide both sides by 4: 4y ÷ 4 = 20 ÷ 4, which gives y = 5."
"Rohan's current age is twice his sister's age. If the sum of their ages is 24, how old is Rohan?","8 years","12 years","16 years","18 years","c","class7-equation-word-problems","Let sister's age = s. Then Rohan's age = 2s. The sum is s + 2s = 24. This gives 3s = 24, so s = 8. Sister is 8, so Rohan is 2 × 8 = 16 years old."
"Expand using the distributive property: 5(2x - 3)","10x - 15","10x - 3","2x - 15","7x - 8","a","class8-multiplying-expressions","Apply the distributive property: a(b + c) = ab + ac. Here, 5(2x - 3) = (5 × 2x) + (5 × -3) = 10x - 15."
"Which identity correctly expands (a + b)²?","a² + b²","a² + ab + b²","a² + 2ab + b²","a² - 2ab + b²","c","class8-standard-identities","The standard identity for the square of a sum is (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b². It is derived from (a + b)(a + b) = a² + ab + ab + b²."
"Using the identity, what is the value of 103 × 97?","9991","10091","9999","10001","a","class8-identity-applications","Recognize that 103 × 97 = (100 + 3)(100 - 3). This fits the identity (a + b)(a - b) = a² - b², with a=100, b=3. So, 100² - 3² = 10000 - 9 = 9991."
"Factorise: 6x + 9","3(2x + 3)","2(3x + 9)","x(6 + 9)","6(x + 9)","a","class8-factorisation-intro","Factorisation finds common factors. The terms 6x and 9 share a common factor of 3. 6x ÷ 3 = 2x and 9 ÷ 3 = 3. Therefore, 6x + 9 = 3(2x + 3)."
"What is the common factor in the expression 4xy + 8y?","4","4y","8","4xy","b","class8-factorisation-methods","Look at coefficients (4 and 8) and variables. The greatest common factor of 4 and 8 is 4. Both terms also have the variable 'y'. Therefore, the common factor is 4y. Factoring gives 4y(x + 2)."

"Solve: (x/3) - 2 = 4","x = 2","x = 6","x = 18","x = 12","c","class8-equations-with-fractions","First, isolate the term with x. Add 2 to both sides: x/3 = 6. Then, multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction: x = 6 × 3, so x = 18."
"Two years ago, a father was three times as old as his son. In five years, he will be twice as old. If the son's current age is 's', which equation represents the first condition?","s - 2 = 3(f - 2)","f - 2 = 3(s - 2)","f + 5 = 2(s + 5)","s + 5 = 2(f + 5)","b","class8-age-problems","Let father's current age = f. Two years ago, their ages were f-2 and s-2. The condition 'father was three times as old' translates to: (Father's age then) = 3 × (Son's age then). So, f - 2 = 3(s - 2)."
"The sum of the digits of a two-digit number is 8. Reversing the digits gives a number 18 less than the original. If the tens digit is 't', what is the correct equation involving the reversal?","(10t + (8-t)) - (10(8-t) + t) = 18","(10(8-t) + t) - (10t + (8-t)) = 18","(t + (8-t)) = 18","10t + (8-t) = 18","a","class8-number-problems","Let tens digit = t. Since the sum is 8, units digit = (8-t). Original number = 10t + (8-t). Reversed number = 10(8-t) + t. The original is 18 more than the reversed, so: Original - Reversed = 18. That is: [10t + (8-t)] - [10(8-t) + t] = 18."
"A car travels 60 km at a certain speed. If the speed had been 10 km/h more, the same journey would have taken 30 minutes less. What is the correct setup if the original speed is 's' km/h?","60/s - 60/(s+10) = 0.5","60/(s+10) - 60/s = 0.5","60/s = 60/(s+10) + 30","s/60 = (s+10)/60 + 0.5","a","class8-money-speed-problems","Time = Distance/Speed. Original time = 60/s hours. New time at speed (s+10) = 60/(s+10) hours. The time difference is 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours. Since the new time is less, Original time - New time = 0.5. So, 60/s - 60/(s+10) = 0.5."

How long will they take to complete it together?","5 days","6 days","12.5 days","25 days","b","class8-work-problems","A's work rate = 1/15 task per day. B's work rate = 1/10 task per day. Combined rate = 1/15 + 1/10 = (2/30 + 3/30) = 5/30 = 1/6 task per day. Time to complete 1 task = 1 / (1/6) = 6 days."
