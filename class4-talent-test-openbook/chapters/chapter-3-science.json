      "content": "## The Great School Bus Chase Story 🚌💨\n\nImagine **Rahul** is late for school! He sees his bus about to leave, so he **runs super fast** to catch it. What happens inside his body?\n\n### The Body's Emergency Team:\n1. **🏃 Leg Muscles** shout: \"We need more ENERGY to run!\"\n2. **🫁 Lungs (Respiratory System)** start breathing faster to grab more **oxygen** from the air.\n3. **❤️ Heart (Circulatory System)** beats faster to pump blood carrying that **oxygen** to the muscles.\n4. **🩸 Blood** delivers oxygen and takes away waste (like carbon dioxide).\n\n### Why Did Drinking Water Help? 💧\nWhen Rahul drank water:\n- It cooled down his body (he was hot from running!)\n- It helped his blood flow better\n- It replaced water lost through sweat\n\n### The Body's Super Team:\n- **Respiratory System** = Air manager (nose, lungs, windpipe)\n- **Circulatory System** = Delivery network (heart, blood, blood vessels)\n- **Muscular System** = Movers (all your muscles!)",
      "codeExample": "### 🧐 Detective Questions:\n1. When you run, why do you breathe faster?  \n   → To get more ______ for your muscles.\n   \n2. What carries oxygen in your blood?  \n   → Tiny red ______ cells.\n   \n3. Why does your heart beat faster when you exercise?  \n   → To pump ______ faster to your muscles.\n\n### 🎮 Act It Out:\nPretend to be different body parts!\n- Be the **Heart**: Go \"thump-thump-thump\" faster and slower\n- Be the **Lungs**: Take deep breaths in and out\n- Be the **Blood**: Run around delivering \"oxygen packages\" to friends\n\n### 📝 Your Turn:\nDraw Rahul running. Add labels: \n1. Lungs breathing fast  \n2. Heart beating fast  \n3. Muscles working hard"

      "content": "## The Magical Kitchen Inside Every Leaf 🍽️✨\n\nLeaves are like **tiny food factories** for plants! They make their own food through a magical process called **PHOTOSYNTHESIS** (say: foh-toh-SIN-thuh-sis).\n\n### The Recipe for Plant Food:\nImagine a leaf needs these ingredients to cook:\n\n**🌬️ 1. Carbon Dioxide (CO₂)**  \n→ Comes from the air we breathe out\n→ Enters through tiny holes in leaves called **stomata**\n\n**💧 2. Water**  \n→ Comes from the roots through the stem\n→ Travels in tiny \"pipes\" called **xylem**\n\n**☀️ 3. Sunlight**  \n→ Gives the energy needed for cooking\n→ Captured by **chlorophyll** (the green stuff!)\n\n### The Magic Happens! 🪄\n**Sunlight + Water + Carbon Dioxide → Food (Sugar/Glucose) + Oxygen**\n\n### What They Give Us:\n1. **Food** for the plant to grow\n2. **Oxygen** for us to breathe! (Thank you, plants!)\n\n### Leaf Shapes & Sizes:\n- Big leaves (like banana leaves) catch more sun\n- Small leaves (like pine needles) save water\n- All leaves have the same job: MAKE FOOD!",
      "codeExample": "### 🌿 Label the Leaf Chef's Kitchen:\nMatch the ingredient to where it comes from:\n1. Sunlight → a. From the air\n2. Water → b. From the sun\n3. Carbon Dioxide → c. From the roots\n\nAnswers: 1-b, 2-c, 3-a\n\n### 🎨 Color & Learn:\n1. Color a leaf **green** (that's the chlorophyll!)\n2. Draw yellow sun rays hitting the leaf\n3. Draw blue arrows showing water coming from roots\n4. Draw tiny \"O₂\" bubbles coming out (that's oxygen!)\n\n### 🤔 Think About It:\nWhy are most leaves flat and wide?  \n→ To catch more ______!\n\nWhat would happen if a plant had no leaves?  \n→ It couldn't make ______!"
