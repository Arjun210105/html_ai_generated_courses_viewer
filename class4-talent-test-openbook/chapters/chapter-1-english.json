They are like word twins who look different!\n\n### Common Tricksters:\n- **two / too / to**:  \n  → `two` is the number 2 (I have **two** eyes).  \n  → `too` means also or very much (I want ice cream **too**! It's **too** hot!).  \n  → `to` shows direction or connection (I go **to** school. I want **to** play).\n\n- **sun / son**:  \n  → The `sun` is the bright, hot star in the sky.  \n  → A `son` is a parent's boy child.\n\n- **see / sea**:  \n  → `see` is what you do with your eyes.  \n  → The `sea` is a huge body of salty water (like an ocean).",
