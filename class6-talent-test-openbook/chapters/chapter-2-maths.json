They do not include fractions, decimals, or negative numbers. Whole numbers are used for counting and ordering things in daily life.[file:1]",
      "codeExample": "### Understanding Whole Numbers:\n- What are whole numbers?\n- Give examples of whole numbers up to 10.\n- How are whole numbers different from fractions?\n\n### Practice:\n- Identify whole numbers from a list\n- Arrange whole numbers in order\n- Count objects using whole numbers"

Integers help us to describe situations that involve both directions, such as gains and losses, above or below sea level, or increase and decrease in temperature.[file:1]",
      "codeExample": "### Understanding Integers:\n- What do integers include?\n- Give examples of positive and negative integers.\n- How do integers represent temperature changes?\n\n### Practice:\n- Plot integers on a number line\n- Compare integers (greater than, less than)\n- Solve simple integer word problems"

      "title": "Divisibility Rules",
      "content": "## Divisibility Rules\n\nThe divisibility rules help us know whether one number can be divided exactly by another, without doing long division. Some important rules are:\n- A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even (0, 2, 4, 6, 8).\n- A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.\n- A number is divisible by 5 if it ends in 0 or 5.\n- A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.\n- A number is divisible by 10 if it ends in 0.\nThese rules are very useful for checking divisibility quickly, finding factors, and simplifying problems in mathematics.[file:1]",
      "codeExample": "### Divisibility Questions:\n- Is 246 divisible by 2? By 3?\n- Check if 125 is divisible by 5.\n- Test 729 for divisibility by 9.\n\n### Practice:\n- Apply rules to check divisibility\n- Find factors using divisibility tests\n- Solve mixed divisibility problems"
